# Balanced-Photodectector
This project aims to develop an balanced photodetector consisting two photodiodes arranged in a differential configuration. The main purpose of a balanced photodiode is to suppress the common mode noise that is present in the electrical signal generated by the photodiode. This is achieved by subtracting the electrical signals generated by the two photodiodes, which cancels out the common mode noise. The resulting output is a differential signal that is proportional to the difference in optical power between the two inputs.
